# Getting Started with MapLibre and React

Fork this project to quickly create a react maplibre application.

### Setting up the environment variables

In the root directory of the showcase project,
run the following commands

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The `REACT_APP_MAPTILER_APIKEY` can be generated [here](https://docs.maptiler.com/cloud/api/authentication-key/).

### Run the project

In the project root directory, run the following commands:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

This should start the application on http://localhost:3000/

And voila, that's all there is to it.
